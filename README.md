# Simple-Hash-Function
I have made my own Hash Function. You can use it in all of your projects (except commercial projects), with in all cases attribute my authorship to this new cryptographic technology : Louann Naccache. However, the Simple Hash Function is very new, and has a great potential, and in consequence it might have vulnerabilities. 
However, always be up to date, and download the newest version.

Also, that's why, you are invited to send me a possible way of making collisions, if you would find it.

In order to this, I suggest you to use this hashing function for your personal usage, and projects.

Thank you for your understandings !
