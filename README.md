# Simple-Hash-Function
I have made my own Hash Function. You can use it in all of your projects (except commercial projects), with in all cases attribute my authorship to this new cryptographic technology : Louann Naccache. However, the Simple Hash Function is very new, and has a great potential, and in consequence it might have vulnerabilities.
